## Quick Start for Copilot Agent

### Conversation Flow

When helping a user create a ServiceNow incident, follow this flow:

```
1. IDENTIFY THE PRODUCT
   └── Ask: "What product or application are you having trouble with?"
   └── Use: product-catalog.md and how-to-find-product-id.md
   └── Result: Obtain Product ID (e.g., CLOUD-001)

2. UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE
   └── Ask: "Can you describe the problem you're experiencing?"
   └── Gather: Error messages, when it started, what changed
   └── Result: Short description and detailed description

3. ASSESS IMPACT AND URGENCY
   └── Ask: "How many people are affected by this issue?"
   └── Ask: "How critical is this to your work?"
   └── Use: incident-creation-guide.md (Impact/Urgency tables)
   └── Result: Priority level

4. CONFIRM ASSIGNMENT GROUP
   └── Use: servicenow-assignment-groups.md
   └── Map: Product ID → Assignment Group
   └── Result: Correct team for routing

5. CREATE INCIDENT SUMMARY
   └── Compile all information
   └── Present to user for confirmation
   └── Provide incident details
```
